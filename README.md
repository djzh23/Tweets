# Twitter Search Application

A Python-based web application that allows users to search and display tweets using the Twitter API. This project was developed as part of a university assignment to learn Python programming and REST API integration.

> **Important Note**: This project was functional for 4 years but is currently limited due to Twitter (now X) API changes. The search endpoint is no longer available in the free tier of the Twitter API. To make this project work with the current Twitter API, you would need to:
> - Upgrade to a paid Twitter API tier
> - Update the API endpoints and authentication methods
> - Modify the code to comply with Twitter's new API v2 specifications

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Flask-Login (User Authentication)
- Flask-SQLAlchemy (Database ORM)
- Twitter API v2 (Note: Requires paid API access)
- SQLite (Database)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Twitter Developer Account with API credentials (Paid tier required for search functionality)
- pip (Python package installer)


## Learning Outcomes

This project served as a practical introduction to:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Web development with Flask
- REST API integration
- Database management with SQLAlchemy
- User authentication and session management
- Frontend development with HTML/CSS
- Error handling and debugging
- Version control with Git

For educational purposes, you can still use this project to learn about:
- Web application development
- User authentication
- Database management
- API integration concepts
- Error handling
- Frontend development
